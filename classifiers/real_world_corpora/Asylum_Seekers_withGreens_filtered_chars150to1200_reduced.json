One of the reasons that the community has lost confidence in federal politicians and the federal parliament is that, somewhere along the line, we stopped representing them. Whether it be climate change or asylum seekers or animal welfare, this place has stopped representing the majority of Australians. There is no better example than when it comes to animal welfare. There is no way in the world that a majority of Australians support the live animal export trade. Every poll you can come up with that is conducted fairly and among the broad members of the community shows overwhelming public support for shutting the trade down—the beef trade, the sheep trade, the whole lot. Because the only way to end the cruelty is to end the trade.",

Yes, we now have a legislated arrangement which will formalise, speed-up and make more reliable the evacuation of sick asylum seekers and refugees from our offshore processing camps, and, yes, we hopefully will now have less reliance on court action to look after sick people, but at the end of the day, this country still has boat tow backs, still has mandatory detention and still has offshore processing.

Both of those goals were achieved, and the record is there. From 2002-03 until the change in the border protection policies by this government last year, there was, relative to the current situation, a very, very small number of arrivals—in some years zero and in other years only a few boats.

They have recklessly supported a bill that does many things, as the Attorney and the Minister for Home Affairs and the minister for immigration outlined this week: transferring permanently to Australia people who, in many cases, have been found in those countries not to be refugees at all, and those who, under a character test, would never be allowed to come to Australia, because, also under that bill, what the Labor Party have done is weakened the ministerial discretion that previously existed that prevents a minister and the government of the day being able to protect our borders. They've watered down that discretion. And, as a result, they've also ignored the fact that, in order to address the very error that they were advised by our security agencies that they'd be making, we would need to immediately reopen the Christmas Island detention centre.",

Importantly, it would build on existing forums, such as the Bali Process, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asian Dialogue of Forced Migrations. In outline, the bill would facilitate the establishment of a network of centres located in and run by Asia-Pacific countries, where asylum seekers could go to be registered, have their immediate humanitarian needs met and lodge a preference for country of resettlement. If the asylum seeker selects Australia and it's within the specified quota, their claim would be assessed in Australia with appropriate oversight, limited time frames and judicial review.

What a load of rubbish! If Labor had bothered to read the bill, they'd see that a fundamental principle of APASS is cooperation and respect for the sovereignty of each member country as well as being alert to the difficulties and priorities of refugee protection for each country involved. No wonder the community is confused about Labor's asylum seeker policy when Labor criticises the government's policy despite helping create it and promising to maintain it and then turns around and criticises the viable APASS alternative.",

It removes the abhorrent and torturous conditions that asylum seekers and refugees currently experience under Australian law in both onshore and offshore detention.

Yes, that is right, Mr Deputy Speaker: $9.6 billion to pay for our response to asylum seekers just in three years. It is forecast to be another $5.7 billion—that is, $5,700 million—over the next four years.

Two years ago she said that a good government had lost its way. That is what the Prime Minister said, and standing orders should be suspended so she can explain exactly what she meant by that. We know that when the Prime Minister said a good government had lost its way she did not actually believe that; because, just a few months ago, when she was again challenged by the member for Griffith, she said that it was not a good government, it was an absolutely shambolic government and it was completely paralysed by the ineptitude and the incompetence of the member for Griffith.

Some years ago, Whitlam observed with characteristic wit that 'Fraser had supplanted him as the principal bogeyman of the hard Right and that this second usurpation had been easier to take than the first'. A sense grew, especially among Liberals, that the Fraser government might have marked time. In the late eighties and the early nineties Malcolm Fraser offered himself to be federal president of the Liberal Party, and twice it did not work out.

This was a serious matter. It was a matter that the New South Wales police had identified and brought to the attention of Customs. There is a serious need to deal with what is happening in our Customs and Border Protection Service. At the end of last year, there were revelations that as many as 20 Customs officials had been allegedly involved in extensive corruption at Sydney airport. As my colleague the member for Stirling has mentioned, these included allegations of aiding drug traffickers as well as money laundering for bikie gangs. An entire shift had been compromised. One Customs and Border Protection officer arrested by the AFP was charged with offences including conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of border controlled precursors, weapons offences, receiving a bribe and abuse of public office.",

Clearly, a culture of corruption is evident in these agencies—in this agency specifically. It is about restoring the confidence of the Australian people in these agencies. The many hardworking enforcement officers who work in the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service, like those who work in similar law enforcement agencies around the country, will be horrified—the good officers, the ones who want to do the right thing, the ones who want to be proud of their organisation and the job it does, because it is an important job. But you have to get the settings right. You have to allow those who want to do the right thing and uphold the integrity of their organisation to be the ones whose activities are rewarded—and rewarded in the sense of having an organisation that has the support, both in terms of the financial support for the resources provided and in terms of the political support, to do their job.",

I make the point that sections 197AB and 197AC of the Migration Act currently permit the minister to make a residence determination to remove children from places covered by the definition of immigration detention. That power exists in the hands of the minister today, and if he has proposals to go and act on that then he should come clean with the Australian people about what they are. And he should also explain today what discussions the government held with charitable groups and other organisations in relation to its mooted policy—it was suggested in the weekend press—that it was preparing to abandon the system of mandatory detention across all of these groups.",

The government goes off with this nonsense notion of a processing centre in East Timor that we will never see happen in this parliament. There is no timetable for action, there is no timetable for this centre opening; there is only a timetable for more talk.

I am further advised that, following containment of the incident, the centre is calm and all the detainees have been briefed by departmental officers. Departmental officials are currently investigating the circumstances of the disturbance. The Australian Federal Police is also conducting an investigation. If a detainee on Christmas Island has committed a serious offence, this will be taken into consideration as part of the assessment as to whether or not they are granted a visa. There were a number of injuries sustained, with 43 individuals receiving medical treatment. I am advised that five of the detention provider staff sustained minor injuries.",

Regional and international cooperation is certainly part of that—working internationally at the source, as the coalition did when we were in government—but also regionally to manage the secondary movements of people and to deal with people smuggling and law enforcement matters. To that end we welcome the announcement by President Yudyono of introducing people-smuggling criminal sanctions in Indonesia and we look forward to that coming into place at sometime in the future, although at this point we do not have any detail of when that might occur.

I asked about what practical changes had been implemented as a result of the policies announced by the new government and the answer was ‘effectively nothing’ practical—that the practical changes that had been introduced were as a result of the 2006 changes. One thing I commend the department on very highly is that they themselves have a culture of continuous improvement in their management of the detention centres. The department and those who run those centres take their responsibilities very seriously, regardless of which party is in government, and they do the best job they can.

I'll say that again: as of March 2022, 1,512 people were held in immigration detention facilities in Australia. There were a further 563 people living in community detention and 10,993 people, so-called illegal maritime arrivals, living in the community after being granted bridging visas. Moreover, there are still 200 asylum seekers in offshore detention, which is effectively imprisonment. Even though, at face value, the people on, say, Nauru are free to go about their lives in that tiny country, it's such a tiny island it's effectively a gulag—no better than the gulags on the Thames a couple of hundred years ago. The average time for people to be held in detention facilities is 700 days. In fact there are some who have been held in offshore detention for over nine years. This is a very real and pressing issue in this country.",

Currently asylum seekers are denied such an appeal option because of a special carve-out for what are referred to as unauthorised maritime arrivals in the ASIO Act. The issue here today and with this bill is not that there should not be security assessments or that genuine risks to Australian national security should not be prevented from entering the community. Regrettably, it has been the case over years that a handful of people have attempted to enter Australia by irregular means, and they have been found—genuinely—to be security risks. But, at the same time, there have been many people who have attempted to enter Australia through irregular means and who have received an adverse security assessment from ASIO, only to ultimately have those adverse assessments overturned. They were found to be in error or, for whatever reason, not warranted.",

If we accept that all people are equal, and if we accept that it is a fundamental basis of our system that all people should have the right to appeal an adverse finding against them, to challenge an adverse assessment, then why on earth do we have this situation in Australia where an Australian citizen who receives an adverse security assessment is entitled to make an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but an asylum seeker is not? The bottom line is that in our law an asylum seeker is regarded as a second-class human being who somehow is inferior and should have fewer rights than an Australian citizen.

Article 9.1 says that no-one shall be subject to arbitrary detention.

The Stone review, for instance, is a non-legislative process operating solely as a matter of policy, and it can be discontinued on a whim. Individuals have no legal right to petition for a review by the Stone review. So in a sense it is not actually a right of appeal.

They do not sit in the boats now enabling our Navy and patrol boat personnel to turn the boats around. There is not a way of going out to sea and turning the boats around and taking them to Indonesia, for two reasons. Reason No. 1: the transnational crime of people smuggling, like other transnational crimes, mutates in the way that it goes about its business, depending on enforcement techniques. Knowing that boats are at risk of being turned around, what happens now is that people disable boats. So you are left with a stark choice: do you leave people to drown at sea or do you go and pick them up? Well, we are Australian. We go and pick them up—of course we do. Then, of course, the attitude of Indonesia has changed. Indonesia does not take boat returns.",

The global facts, which they choose to ignore, are that in the period 2001 to 2003, following their introduction of the Pacific solution, we had a radical global decrease in the numbers coming from Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka because of global factors operating around the world. All countries experienced a global reduction. What has happened in the period subsequent to that—2007, 2008 and into the present time—is that around the world there has been a global increase in the outflow from Sri Lanka, Iraq and Afghanistan, and all countries in the world are experiencing an increase in the number of arrivals coming from those countries.",

Most recently—in fact, I believe only several days ago—two-thirds of a group of 50 Sri Lankans who arrived in this country in April were returned to Sri Lanka, given that it has been determined that they were not refugees. In fact, a group of six men who were involved in protest action while in detention were removed from Christmas Island on Saturday and arrived safely in Colombo that night. Thirty others from that same boat have now returned to Sri Lanka voluntarily after their claims for protection were thoroughly assessed.",

There were 1.5 million refugees at that time. There are 10.5 million today. A lot has changed since then and, frankly, a lot has changed as to how the refugee convention is now contorted and interpreted and used—whether it is by advocates or by the smugglers themselves—and how it is interpreted in the courts, which I think goes well beyond the original intention of that document which was signed by the Menzies government. That is a debate that I am sure will continue. That is a debate the coalition participated in and one we have expressed great reservations over.

The Bali process was focused under the Howard government as a regional deterrence framework, not a regional accommodation framework, which is what we get from the government today. The government has taken that Bali process off course, turning to regional processing hubs and magnets to draw even more people into the region.

They contain two major changes. In the area of the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio, there is a change to outcome 4 of the appropriation for that department which deals essentially with offshore arrangements for the processing of asylum seekers. That involves an increase of $86,264,000. Also, in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010, there is an increase in expenditure of $34 million for capital works at Christmas Island. They are large increases which the government is asking for—$86 million and a further $34 million. But when we break it down and look at how the government actually planned for this year’s budget and what they expected to happen, and when we look particularly at the area of outcome 4—and, in particular, under 4.3 for administrative expenses and departmental expenses relating to 4.3.1 and 4.3.2—the story gets even more concerning.",

What that actually means in terms of how much the government will be spending this year compared to last year is an increase of $144 million—or an increase of 126 per cent over what was spent on these matters in 2008-09. Just to put that in total terms, the government is now asking to spend $257,429,000 this year on the issue of offshore processing, compared to an actual figure for 2008-09 of $113,778,000.

I note that recently the former Prime Minister the member for Griffith, when pressed on this during a seminar he was addressing, said that the voters made him do it. It was not his decision; they made him do it, because he had promised it. So he blamed the voters for his decision to abolish the measures.

I hope he is proud of the consequences of those decisions. We all know of the chaos, cost and tragedy that followed those decisions.

These measures are a necessary extension and consolidation of the government's successful border protection policies and are part of a broad package of measures which will tackle the management of the backlog of illegal maritime arrivals, known as IMAs, and bring important enhancements to the integrity of Australia's protection regime.",

The honourable member raises that latter point in terms of the reaction from regional countries.

You would think if the government were honest in putting its budget papers together that it would actually be allocating additional expenditure to cope with such an increase. But you will not find that in these budget papers. When you look at the onshore detention network costs you will find that in 2009-10 they are expecting this year to round out less, and then over the forward years there will be virtually no change to those onshore detention costs. The Curtin detention centre will be reopened by this government to take those whose claims assessments have been frozen—and we have had almost 1,000 people turn up since that was introduced.

My point is this: this government is not being upfront with the true costs of their failed policies in these budget documents.

They are the two processes which apply. In the case of this particular vessel, you will have a mix of individuals, some of whom have already been processed by the UNHCR previously in Indonesia, others of whom have not.

As I informed the House yesterday in terms of an arrival of a boatload of some 50 individuals back in April, two thirds of those were sent back to Sri Lanka in the course of the last week or so. That is normal process. Thirdly, in the case of the identification of those who do have bona fide refugee status, what then occurs when it comes to offshore processing in the case of Indonesia is that negotiations occur with resettlement countries, as has been the practice since time immemorial.

Most fundamentally, these failings and these mistruths appear in one of the most important documents the government publish each year, and that is their own budget. In the budget this year, for 2010-11, the government came in here and asked for $471 million for asylum seeker management. That is a lot of money—and it is certainly a lot more money than they asked for the previous year, which was around $170 million. What was more troubling was that they said that this was only going to be in order to accommodate some 2,000 arrivals this financial year. That figure was exceeded by about December in this financial year, if not earlier. The government then came back into this place for their own budget most recently and asked for another $290 million, on top of the $470 million, to pay for the blow-out in their costs due to the failure of their policy of asylum seeker management in this country. It is now costing $760 million in the additional estimates.",

So there is going to be a half a billion dollar decline in the government’s budget from this year to next financial year. That is the untruth that this government are trying to present to the Australian people about the cost of their failures in border protection. If costs stay at the current level of $760 million a year over the next three years, that is going to blow a $1½ billion hole in the government’s budget. That is on top of the $1.4 billion excess they have already had in blowing out costs in this area. So the government cannot even get the costs right in their own budget or tell the truth about the real costs of their policy failures.",

That was a pretty bountiful passage for the people smugglers. That boat turned up just a few days ago. So there is a lot of money involved. What the coalition’s plans and policies are designed to do is to deny the people smugglers a product to sell. The way that we have done that—and I stress that we have done it; it is not a theory; it is not just a policy; it is something that has been proven—is by denying a product by removing the certainty of the immigration outcome that is potentially on offer to people who seek to get on these boats through paying the people smuggler.",

Certainly, there have been circumstances where illegal boat arrivals have tried to present at oil rigs or resource installations at sea. Currently, all Australian sea and resource installations are defined as excised offshore places so if an IMA reaches an oil rig they are not taken to have arrived in Australia's migration zone and can be processed offshore.

In April 2017, the government came to an agreement with the government of Papua New Guinea that it would close.

This vital issue of people-smuggling and the integrity of our borders and our immigration policy is one which deserves and demands calm and rational debate. The simple fact is that the object of government policy should be to eliminate people-smuggling so that, as far as practicable, there are no unauthorised maritime arrivals of people seeking asylum in Australia. To say that is not racist—nor is it heartless or lacking in compassion. People-smuggling is a vile trade. Millions of dollars are made by the people-smugglers as they put at risk not just the lives of their often desperate passengers but the lives of the Australian defence personnel who have to intercept them, or indeed rescue them, on the high seas.",

When the Howard government was faced with a growing tide of asylum seekers arriving by boat, it took hard decisions to stop the flow. In 2001-02 there were 19 boats, with 3,039 people on board. The following year no boats arrived. Over the next five years there were a total of 18 boats, carrying 301 people. On average 60 asylum seekers arrived by boat each year. In just over a year, since the Rudd government began dismantling the immigration policies of the Howard government, we have, as I remind the House, had 41 boats arrive, carrying nearly 2,000 people. If the object of policy is to prevent and discourage these unauthorised maritime arrivals, this enormous upsurge in arrivals must be a failure of policy. Of that there can be no question.",

What she did not tell the House was that this was almost entirely the consequence of the dramatic number of asylum applications in South Africa, because of the tragedies in southern Africa. The UNHCR notes that if South Africa alone is excluded—this does not include the other big increases in applications for protection in the rest of Africa—‘the global increase in 2008 would have been only four per cent’. It is still an extraordinary toll of misery, but the proposition that she was putting to the House that there had been a sudden increase in the push factors since the election of the Rudd government, or since August last year, is just untrue and it is proved to be untrue from the very document that she was misrepresenting.",

Retrospectivity, clearly, as a matter of high principle, should be avoided at all costs and only be used in the most extreme of circumstances. Of course, indefinite mandatory detention is at odds with numerous international agreements that this country has signed up to in good faith. One of those international agreements, which I often refer to in this place, and will again, is the Rome Statute, where it is explicitly detailed that it is a crime against humanity to hold anyone in detention indefinitely.

That bill, if it were ever to become law, would abolish unlawful mandatory detention of asylum seekers, refugees and noncitizens. By the way, in doing so, it would have the effect of ending offshore detention. I do note that in last night's budget even more money is being thrown at increasing the capacity of the Christmas Island detention facility.

Further to that, it has freed up more than 1,000 places for women at risk, which we noted earlier today at the opening of Refugee Week.",

By stopping the boats, we are able not only to get the budget under control and get the refugee and humanitarian program back under control and ensure it has integrity, but we are able to deal with the problems in the detention network and with the issues with offshore processing that were left to us by the previous government. Labor did leave us a mess. They left us a mess because $1.2 billion was the shortfall in funding for effectively implementing offshore processing. They announced it but they did not fund it. They are great on announcements—they announce surpluses that are never delivered and they announce offshore processing policies that were never funded.",

I can tell you that at the last election the previous government had provided education to just 24 children on Christmas Island. There is a slight problem with that in that there were 140 primary-age children on Christmas Island at the time, and there were 425 children on Christmas Island at the time. That was addressed in this budget. There is $2.6 million to ensure that not just 24 children but every child held in detention on Christmas Island will go to school every single day. That is just one of the examples of cleaning up the mess. But the job is getting easier, because the number of children in detention is declining. The number of children right across our own networks and offshore is now fewer than 1,000. It has fallen by a third since the election. It has fallen by almost 50 per cent in mainland centres across Australia. You know how you get children out of detention? You stop the boats. That is how you do it. That is what this government is doing. That is why children are coming out of detention and that is why this government has been successful and you lot failed.",

I understand the opposition may have a bit more to say at a later stage of these proceedings, but it is important to simply sum up, again, the purposes of the bill. The bill amends the Migration Act to implement a range of measures which will enhance the integrity and efficiency of Australia's protection status determination process. These measures will provide the government with the necessary tools to assess asylum seekers irrespective of their mode of arrival in Australia through an effective and coherent protection processing system. The bill provides legislative support for decision makers who assess the claims of people seeking protection in this country. The measures in this bill clarify lines of responsibility—it is up to the person seeking protection in Australia to establish their identity and their claims to protection in good faith and as soon as possible. It is not the decision maker's responsibility to make out a claim for protection.",

It also makes clear that asylum seekers must present their claims and supporting evidence at the earliest opportunity. Where an asylum seeker raises claims or evidence at the Refugee Review Tribunal for the first time they must have a reasonable explanation for not having raised those claims or evidence before a primary decision was made.

They are sick of a government which cannot protect our borders and cannot do one of the most fundamental things a national government is elected to do. The government can call them racists if they like, but at the next election they will reap what they sow in making those claims.",

At its heart, this bill is about protection. It is about strengthening our borders and protecting the Australian people from subversion and violation by international crime syndicates.

We took the advice and recommendations of our security and border protection agencies—something the leader of the Labor Party failed to do when he came into this place yesterday and wilfully weakened Australia's border protection regime. The recommendations we have taken are to strengthen the posturing, positioning and resources of Operation Sovereign Borders, as required by those who advised us to do so. Secondly, we have commenced the process of reopening Christmas Island—as recommended we do—to deal with any possible future arrivals as well as any transfers that may now take place. I have also asked the home affairs department to provide advice on the implementation of the measures that were set out in the parliament yesterday and were voted upon, moved and supported by the Labor Party in defiance of the national security advice that they were very well aware of.",

I am asked about what impacts changes of policy on border protection have on people smugglers, and there is plenty of evidence on this fact. In August 2008, the Rudd Labor government at that time completed the demolition of the successful Howard government policies when they put through the abolition of temporary protection visas, following their own turn-back on turn-backs, and also going against and shutting down the Pacific solution. We know what happened after that—we went from an average of three boats a year under the last six years of the Howard government to an average of 165 boats a year over the next five years. Some almost 1,200 deaths later, some 800 boats later, and some 50,000 illegal arrivals later, this government has pulled the rug on Labor's people smuggler's picnic. That is what we have done. We have put the policies in place that have ensured people smugglers no longer have a product to sell, and it was achieved as a result of a change of policy and as a result of a change of leadership.",

He had survived a very impoverished upbringing in which he had worked from a young age to support his mother. As a result, his formal education finished before the end of primary school.

Mohammed then turned around his boat and headed back towards Indonesia.

Wawan and the other Indonesian man followed Mohammed's directions for another two days until they were intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy off the coast of Western Australia.

It does seem strange, doesn't it, that the move to shut down and quash the inquiry happened only hours after the media were allowed into that detention camp for the first time? What they saw inside that camp was horrendous. We know the conditions are terrible. The United Nations told us that and so did Amnesty International.",

For far too long the situation of refugees and asylum seekers has been used as a political issue. It has been used to win elections. It has been used to increase poll numbers. It has become a toxic political debate, where the only winners are fear and hate, and the losers are the moral character of our nation and, tragically, the fate of the refugees, who are people, just like Australians, who are desperate for peace and safety for their families. The treatment of refugees in Australia is not simply a political issue and it should not remain just an issue of political debate. It is a moral issue. It is about how we treat some of the most vulnerable people. Our response as a nation defines our national character. This issue reveals how we want to view ourselves as a nation within the rest of the world.",

As a consequence of that, he died in a hospital in Brisbane. He represents everything that is wrong with our detention centre network. He was a young man and he committed no crime. He was a man who, under international convention, was found to be a genuine refugee. And yet the Australian government's response was to detain this man indefinitely, with no prospect of him being able to enjoy the freedom and liberties that he so desperately fought to find. Of course, the response from the Prime Minister was cruel. It was heartless: to suggest that the nation should not be 'misty-eyed' at the death of a young man who has died as a direct result of Australia's policies of offshore detention. It shows a man who has become so heartless in his role—so completely disconnected from what it means to offer a human response to a problem countries right around the world are facing.",

We believe the government has comprehensively failed to make the case for the legislation. We believe it is discriminatory because it engages and limits a number of human rights and it breaches a number of international conventions that Australia has signed up to over many years, including but not limited to the refugee convention. This legislation seeks to discriminate against a particular cohort who are described as transitory persons who were at least 18 years of age and who were taken to a regional processing country after 19 July 2013. It seeks to prevent those people from making a valid application for an Australian visa.",

Ultimately, this committee report lends yet more credibility and yet more weight to the argument that, in fact, this legislation should be rejected by the Senate when eventually the government brings it on for debate in this place. It should be rejected because it is in breach of human rights, because it is in breach of a number of the international obligations to which the Australian government has signed up, because it will result in trauma to families and children, and because ultimately it is racist legislation.

Back in 2014, the government brought in the Migration Amendment (Character and General Visa Cancellation) Act 2014, known as the character act. This act introduced new powers to refuse or cancel visas on character grounds. It meant that a person's visa would automatically be cancelled if, among other things, the person was imprisoned for a sentence of 12 months or more or was convicted of a sexual offence involving a child. Significant concerns were raised at the time by organisations like the Refugee Council of Australia and the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre.

While I was only two years old at the time when his reign as Prime Minister of this country ended, my commitment to and passion for immigration policy in this country taught me from my university days that it was the leadership of Malcolm Fraser that allowed our nation to open our doors to those most in need following the Vietnam War. But more important than that was the practical implementation of the end of the White Australia policy. While Gough Whitlam took great steps to end the White Australia policy, the practical implementation came from Fraser opening our doors to our regional neighbours, encouraging Asian migration, and offering a helping hand and a hand of compassion to those on our doorstep.",

I have always been very humbled to have Malcolm on the other end of the phone for advice or sometimes just for me to vent my frustration with the current policies. He always showed me that it is possible to be both strong and compassionate, and that showing compassion to people is not a sign of weakness.

I have a statement from them that I would like to read, because Malcolm's commitment to working with people in the local community never weakened, even in his later years, whether it was through the books that he wrote, the newspaper articles that he contributed, the speeches that he made at dinners or the statesman-like role that he fulfilled.

Despite the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection being asked about that in the chamber, in the other place, only two hours after saying he could not answer because it was an operational matter we then had the chief of this entire military led response, the lieutenant-general—because isn't it good to send out the military when you are dealing with poor refugees on rickety wooden boats—saying, 'No, we haven't bought any boats because Indonesia doesn't want us to.' This is the pathetic nature of this government in relation to being upfront with the Australian people and respectful of the parliament's right to scrutinise government policy.",

It's worth reminding the chamber that, in fact, last week Senator Hanson rose to her feet and said she was very proud of the Labor Party for voting with her and Senator Anning and the coalition to do over migrants and make life more difficult for migrants in this country.",

Philip Moss's review of the conditions inside the Nauru detention centre highlighted clearly that underreporting of incidents is a regular occurrence and is a serious problem because staff themselves have no confidence in the government's systems to respond seriously. That is why we must have mandatory reporting of abuse and assaults of all staff inside our facilities. It is why we must allow the media to access our facilities. It is why we need sufficient training requirements for all staff, particularly guards. Above all else, it is important that we remove the threat of jail that hangs over the head of staff simply for speaking out when things go wrong.",

Think about the Border Force Act, for example, which says to a doctor or a nurse or a health professional, 'We'll make a criminal out of you if you stand up and say that you've witnessed abuse in offshore detention facilities,' or indeed the ASIO Act or the vast pieces of anti-terrorism legislation, which make it almost impossible for journalists to report on abuses that go on right across Australia's network of asylum seeker detention centres.",

That is why we see dozens and dozens of antidepressant pills handed out every morning, every afternoon and every night in the Manus Island and Nauru detention centres. People have gone mad. These places drive people crazy. The lack of hope kills their souls. Let us put some limits on how long these people have to live in these places without any hope. Process their claims. If they are not refugees, send them home; if they are, get on with it. Stop killing them slowly. I look forward to the amendments being debated.",

There are many, many good people inside the Labor Party who want to reach some sort of accommodation, who want that for the sake of progressive politics. But there is also a group inside the Labor Party, many of them represented here today, who are lashing out in anger.

This bill would help to ensure that we actually offer protection where protection is needed.",

This is a dark, shameful and bloody chapter in Australia's national story. One day there will be a royal commission into immigration detention, including offshore detention, and those responsible will be held to account. There have been crimes against humanity committed by the Australian government. They have destroyed far too many lives. It is time for this chapter to end. It is time for this calamitous and shameful chapter in our country's history to be drawn to a close. The way the government could do that is by simply accepting the kind and generous offer that the New Zealand government has made.",

Also, of course, one of the things that I am extremely concerned about is the impact on people's claims, through no fault of their own but through the lax management of people's data, such as when the immigration department accidentally uploaded the personal information of over 10,000 asylum seekers. You would remember, Mr Chairman, this happened a number of years ago. All of those people have now been put at further risk because of that data breach.",

It does not need to be like that, it should not be like that and the government should be banned from locking up refugees alongside criminals.

He then doubled down on his hate speech by despicably trying to link refugees to terrorist attacks in Turkey and France. Let us call out Mr Dutton's remarks for what they are: turning your back on an apology to the stolen generation is bigotry; joking about 'Cape York time' is, at the very least, casual racism; calling refugees 'illiterate and innumerate' job thieves is xenophobia; and linking asylum seekers to terrorism is divisive bigotry that should have stopped over 50 years ago.

As we know, this toxic debate about immigration and refugees does nothing to help build us up as a nation. In fact, it tears at the very fabric of our communities. I would argue that the rhetoric around refugees and asylum seekers—particularly in the last 12 months, but increasingly as we get towards an election—is becoming nastier, dirtier and even more dangerous.",

It is worth pointing out that this is an Tony Abbott era bill being continued by the Turnbull government, as have so many other policy settings, such as emissions reduction targets, fossil fuel subsidies and the detention of women and children seeking asylum. This legislation owes far more to the government's desire to be seen to be doing something to respond to the domestic and international challenges of violent extremism than it does to a genuine desire to make Australia and Australians safer at home and overseas.

However, you cannot solve a human rights crisis by creating another human rights crisis, and that is exactly what Operation Sovereign Borders has done. We know that of the men currently on Manus Island—98 per cent of whom, by the way, have been found by the Papua New Guinea government to be genuine refugees—88 per cent have been found by UNHCR psychological experts to have mental health issues caused as a result of their incarceration on Manus Island. That is a human rights crisis.",

I believe this is the biggest human rights settlement in Australia's history. It is also the biggest admission of responsibility in Australian human rights history, because today Minister Dutton has accepted that he, Prime Minister Turnbull and, before them, Mr Morrison when he was minister for immigration and, before him, the Australian Labor Party, who established the detention centre on Manus Island and who supported and continue to support the policy of indefinite detention on both Manus Island and Nauru are responsible for the illegality of offshore detention and for the massive harm that offshore detention causes to our fellow human beings.",

We have seen dozens of serious injuries. We have seen hundreds of men suffering physical and psychological torment because of the Labor and Liberal parties' choice to detain them on Manus Island.

The senators’ comments this afternoon were more about those individual asylum seekers than about the people smugglers that they continue to say we need to tackle. I guess that gets to the heart of the problem: the coalition do not believe we should have refugees in Australia. They do not believe that we should have a compassionate approach. If they did, they would understand that those people seeking asylum are not illegal. Terms like ‘illegal’ are not only offensive but absolutely inaccurate. It is actually not illegal to arrive in Australia and seek asylum and refuge. I find it incredibly distressing and unfortunate that some people continue to use this to exploit desperate asylum seekers for their own political advantage. I think Senator Arbib said something quite important: perhaps it is because of your own irrelevancy that you turn to demonising those who are more desperate than you.",
