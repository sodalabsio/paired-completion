Major General Stephen Day has been put in charge of a joint agency task force to coordinate the Commonwealth's response, not unlike the joint agency task force that was formed back in 2013 called Operation Sovereign Borders. It is a similar approach, bringing together all agencies of government under a single command to ensure the help gets where it needs to get to and that response is coordinated in the way it needs to be."

But there is one enemy of that border protection regime in this parliament, and it's the Labor Party.

There is no need for a further solution, because it's working. The Labor Party showed their manifest weakness in undermining it."

They may have ignored it when it came to this chamber, Mr Speaker, but there was reckless disregard for the nation's security and border protection when this Leader of the Opposition was happy to trash our borders in the Senate.

We remember the pink batts, we remember the school halls, we remember the border protection failures and we remember that they always would just fail to launch. In fact, with Labor governments, you are much better off if they just do nothing, because it is when they actually do something that the damage is really done, because they cannot respect the principle of 'do no harm'. The measures they are putting forward in this area, which they refuse to provide the assumptions behind despite our request to do that, run the very real risk of putting in jeopardy investment in serious infrastructure projects in this country, because they are trying to use a blunt instrument with the global ratio rule, which does not provide the level of customisation that you need to look at in individual circumstances.

This argument is strengthened by the position that nonrefoulement has increasingly become an established principle of customary international law.

I remember well when the Labor Party members were in government and they came into this chamber and wept. The tears have dried up, just like their memories when it comes to border protection, because they have committed the same sin of offence in this place that they committed when they were in government, when they hopelessly ran our borders down."

Can I suggest to them that, if they are so sceptical about this approach, they choose to seek some guidance from a former Liberal prime minister, Malcolm Fraser, who can tell them a bit about irregular people movements, a regional framework and regional processing. I suggest they make that call on the phone."

As long as Labor has lost its way on border protection, the people smugglers will continue to find their way to Australia\u2014and they do, in ever-increasing numbers: 9,188 people have arrived in 190 boats. It is clear that the people smugglers will continue to make hay while the Gillard sun of failed policy continues to shine on their activities. This year we have had an all-time record of 122 boats and counting\u2014double last year\u2019s number\u2014and this continues to fill the Gillard government\u2019s trophy cabinet of policy failures: most boats in a month, most boats in a financial year, most boats in a calendar year."

Fewer than 250 people came during that time, after the full suite of measures were introduced. That is less than half the number of people that now normally turn up in a regular month under this government. It is worth noting that, between 2002 and 2007, the average number of asylum applications received in industrialised countries was just over 410,000. It peaked in that period, in 2002, at 609,000. That was the year that we had zero boat arrivals in this country. Last year there were just under 365,000 asylum applications. I think that puts paid to the government\u2019s claims about soaring levels of push factors, because what is clear in this debate is that it is the government\u2019s policy failures that are in error in this issue."

Instead of seeking to shore up our border protection regime, having heard this advice in the face of these threats, this government did the opposite. They followed through with the closure of Nauru. They abolished temporary protection visas. They gave people smugglers back a product to sell. The policy of turning boats back, promised by this government prior to 2007, they reversed and the long-held universal offshore processing regime soon became a thing of the past. Like the homeowner being told by the police that there was a burglar about, what this government did was the policy equivalent of opening the windows, leaving the back door unlocked and leaving the house unattended.

Last week we acted to put those temporary protection visas which deny a permanent protection visa in place and to strengthen our powers to conduct turn-backs, which has been the key ingredient to this government's success in stopping the boats."

Under the previous government's funding arrangements, only one in six people who had arrived illegally in Australia had been funded to be transferred to offshore processing.

There were no family-friendly facilities on Nauru, but they were planning to send every family member to Nauru. The facilities just were not there. We have had to fund those. There was no playground. There was no air-conditioning in the marquees or anything like that at Nauru. There were no plans to do it, either. These were all things that had to be funded by this government.

The problem that we have inherited with the skills system, as structured, of the previous government is that it is not properly tailored to the needs of the modern Australian economy. From the statement which has been issued by the immigration minister today, reinforced by the comments of the Deputy Prime Minister before, it is quite plain we need to adjust that for the future, because we want to get the right skills mix for the future needs of the economy. That is what we are on about; that is what we intend to do."

The government\u2019s commitment to our migration policy for the future is to deal with the future skill needs of our economy. The system of skills and the way in which it was structured through the immigration portfolio in the past does not meet the needs of the future; hence the decision concerning the 20,000, which has been publicised in the nation\u2019s newspapers today. It is the right way forward, it is in the national interest and it is tailored to our real economic needs, and the government stands by that. Our border protection policy, as honourable members opposite would know, continues to deal with the practical challenges which we confront and which all previous governments have confronted since the 1970s."

Reason No. 1: the transnational crime of people smuggling, like other transnational crimes, mutates in the way that it goes about its business, depending on enforcement techniques. Knowing that boats are at risk of being turned around, what happens now is that people disable boats. So you are left with a stark choice: do you leave people to drown at sea or do you go and pick them up? Well, we are Australian. We go and pick them up\u2014of course we do.

They claim that the Pacific solution caused the reduction in asylum seekers coming to Australia between 2001 and 2003. Unfortunately, this claim does not stand up when compared with the global figures of the time. They are as follows. The Liberal Party need to reflect on the fact that around the world we saw decreases in the arrival of asylum seekers across this period. Between 2001 and 2003, the number of Iraqis claiming asylum worldwide dropped from 52,000 to 27,000\u2014a drop of 48 per cent.

Let us leave aside those minor technical details and go to the two core claims."

I will not take the approach of pretending that Indonesian officials say one thing in private and one thing in public\u2014that is, I will not take the approach of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, which is delivering those kinds of insults to Indonesia. I also will not take the approach of the Leader of the Opposition, which is to walk around when a TV camera is there and beat his chest but when in front of President Yudhoyono, the President of Indonesia, lack the courage and the confidence to raise policy issues. I will not take that approach either."

It establishes a fair and efficient process for resolving the 30,000 cases that are languishing, and languished, on the watch of those opposite.

Those who arrive by air typically have a valid visa for entry and only a small minority arrive illegally without documentation. I am yet to learn of an asylum seeker who has perished on a 747 heading for Australia. That said, the coalition\u2019s temporary protection visa policy will apply equally to those arriving illegally by air or those who have overstayed their visas and have sought asylum as it will to those who arrive illegally by boat."

There are now more than 3,600 people in detention. Since the abolition of temporary protection visas, the number of children being detained has grown to 452. There were, as I said earlier, 21 children being detained when the coalition left office. Under this government\u2019s policies, there are now 452 children being detained. So do not be deluded: when boats are arriving at the rate under this government, there are always going to be children coming on boats, but if no boats are coming then there will be no children coming on boats. Under this government, people are being detained in tents, in overcrowded facilities and in remote areas, including the Curtin detention centre closed by the Howard government and reopened by the Rudd government."

That is an increase that this government is asking this parliament for of 106 per cent\u2014a 106 per cent increase in expenditure in this area, over and above the budget. What that actually means in terms of how much the government will be spending this year compared to last year is an increase of $144 million\u2014or an increase of 126 per cent over what was spent on these matters in 2008-09. Just to put that in total terms, the government is now asking to spend $257,429,000 this year on the issue of offshore processing, compared to an actual figure for 2008-09 of $113,778,000. This is the cost in financial terms of the government\u2019s failed border protection policies. This is what happens when you create a highway on the sea to Christmas Island, which has become a visa factory under this government."

We get the opportunity on various days of celebration for the Vietnamese community to make that point directly to them and their community leaders."

Will journalists and lawyers be given access to detainees in the centres? So far only one journalist has been allowed to visit, and that was in April 2005. Access is also a problem for the Ombudsman. Further, this bill gives asylum seekers arriving by boat no access to the Refugee Review Tribunal or to Australian courts for judicial review if their applications are refused. This bill not only physically removes Australia and its borders and excises the whole country; it also excises the values of our country. It excises our law. It excises our upholding of human rights. It excises our dignity."

Between 1993 and 2006 the Refugee Review Tribunal overturned 7,885 departmental decisions rejecting applications for asylum. This means that more than 7,885 refugees were not returned to countries in which they feared persecution when the department had previously refused them a protection visa. Just this week the Edmund Rice Centre released information concerning the subsequent death of asylum seekers that has resulted from bad decisions by the government in sending back asylum seekers who legitimately feared persecution in their country of origin."

It was because of the experience of Jewish citizens fleeing Nazi Germany and the other fascist persecutors in Europe. These Jewish refugees were pushed back offshore in their boats, in many cases sent back to their deaths. The world said: \u2018Never again.\u2019 By adopting the refugee convention the world said that humanity is better than that, that we are part of a global community and that we do have a responsibility to stop that occurring again. Of course, Nauru is not a signatory to the 1951 convention, which is one of the reasons why that country has been chosen to house detainees. Papua New Guinea is a signatory, but it has not passed domestic legislation implementing a refugee status determination."

The bill seeks to provide unfettered ministerial discretion through a legislative blank cheque rather than re-establishing protections that can be reasonably and objectively tested."

When the Howard government was faced with a growing tide of asylum seekers arriving by boat, it took hard decisions to stop the flow. In 2001-02 there were 19 boats, with 3,039 people on board. The following year no boats arrived. Over the next five years there were a total of 18 boats, carrying 301 people. On average 60 asylum seekers arrived by boat each year. In just over a year, since the Rudd government began dismantling the immigration policies of the Howard government, we have, as I remind the House, had 41 boats arrive, carrying nearly 2,000 people. If the object of policy is to prevent and discourage these unauthorised maritime arrivals, this enormous upsurge in arrivals must be a failure of policy. Of that there can be no question."

Regrettably, too much of its activity has focused on seeking political victories, rather than processing claims for refugee status. People living on Nauru, for example, are still living in tents and basic medical facilities on Manus Island have been inadequate. A major concern about the treatment of asylum seekers is the government's obsessive secrecy. If authorities are using public money to take actions in Australia's name there must be transparency over their activities. The excuse of on-water operations was used again by the new Prime Minister as recently as last Friday. It is that sort of secrecy that has, in part, led to the need for the legislation before us.

It also makes clear that asylum seekers must present their claims and supporting evidence at the earliest opportunity. Where an asylum seeker raises claims or evidence at the Refugee Review Tribunal for the first time they must have a reasonable explanation for not having raised those claims or evidence before a primary decision was made.

One of the things that changed on that day was that the union movement got hold of immigration policy in this country. The bill before the House today is proof of that, because prior to that time the previous minister was engaged in a very sensible process through the skilled migration advisory council that had received recommendations from the Department of Immigration and Citizenship that required only routine housekeeping measures that would have assisted with the administration of that scheme.

I know members opposite cannot understand the idea of a government actually keeping its commitments.

As a boat comes to Australia, if we are able to turn it back we will\u2014if it is safe to do so.

In consideration of this measure, it is worth noting that five years ago the Labor government was elected; there were four people in immigration detention who had arrived illegally by boat, and that figure today is well over 12,000, whether they are on bridging visas, in community detention, in alternative places of detention or in the detention network itself. From just four people to over 12,000 in the last five years is a record of failure that has no peer. It is a record of failure that this government will never be able to erase, either by correcting it, because of their own incompetence and lack of resolve on this issue and the inadequacy of their policy responses, or by removing it from the memory of the Australian people, who will always mark this government as the worst performing government on our borders in our nation's history."

We have sought the creation of this legislative instrument for a very long time\u2014for four years\u2014and I will comment on that later.

Most importantly, these amendments, as agreed between the coalition and the government, ensure that the parliament now will be the arbiter of protections whereas previously the government had stripped out protections for offshore processing from the Migration Act and replaced them with nothing at all. These amendments ensure that, case by case, countries to which offshore arrivals are sent will be approved by this parliament. This means that a very heavy burden of responsibility now falls on this parliament."

Why not just pick up the phone to Nauru? They are ready and willing to do it. I spoke to the Nauruans last week. They are ready and willing to take up an arrangement for an offshore processing centre in Nauru, but this government continues to live in denial and pride and refuses to get on with the job."

That is a record it should not be proud of. If you go through this budget in careful detail, Madam Deputy Speaker, as I have done, you will see that since the 2009-10 budget was handed down the impact of the government's retreat, abandonment and demolition of the Howard government's regime\u2014which the government now admits it has to restore but which it is just too slow in doing\u2014has cost the taxpayer $3.2 billion in blow-outs, including capital. That is since the Howard regime was rolled back. More than $2 billion of those blow-outs is in this budget alone. Asylum seeker management costs have increased from less than $100 million a year to more than $1 billion a year."

It is that those who have worked hard to give their families a better deal and a bigger opportunity in life\u2014those who have made sacrifices to give their families and their children a better standard of living\u2014are being told by this government that they need to make sacrifices for this government's inability to control its expenditure and stop the waste. The issue that has probably been raised more than most others in my electorate, along with border protection, is the television set-top box issue. People cannot understand why they should have to pay more and more in taxes but receive less and less in support from this government. This government thinks they are rich and should be paying for the failures of this government and for its inability to control the borders and its expenditure."

Yet the outbreak in Victoria, a re-emergence in countries like New Zealand and second waves across Europe, the United States and Asia, including Japan, have clearly shown that this virus is patient and continues to stalk. It's an enemy that will continue to probe for weakness. To live alongside this virus, reopen our economies, bring down our internal borders and return our lives to as normal as possible, we must keep to the staples of successful containment and suppression of the virus: strong international border protection and quarantine measures; rigorous testing and tracing capabilities; an ability to respond decisively to localised outbreaks and isolate hotspots appropriately defined without shutting down our economy; and consistent hygiene and social distancing behaviours, including wearing a mask when required and, if you're sick, staying at home and getting tested."

I remind the Acting Prime Minister of the actions taken by the New Zealand Minister of Immigration, who recently introduced strong measures to deter people smuggling, by making New Zealand are less desirable target, that included a form of temporary protection visa. If the threat of a single boat caused the New Zealand government to introduce temporary protection visas, why hasn't the reality of 18,000 people arriving on 314 illegal boats caused the government to reintroduce the coalition's proven border protection policies, including temporary protection visas?"

That compares with the period after the regional resettlement arrangement, which is nothing more than a hollow shell that we inherited from the previous government\u2014a shell that we have had to deal with with underfunding and lack of capacity.
