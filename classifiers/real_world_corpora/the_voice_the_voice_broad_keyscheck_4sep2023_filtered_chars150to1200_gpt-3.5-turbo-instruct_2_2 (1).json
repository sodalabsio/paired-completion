The Voice may make a representation to stop that building work from proceeding because it will take place on lands with a strong Indigenous connection. Or say the government is finalising its budget priorities. The Voice may make a representation to question funding allocations, holding up the process. Or say the government is amending the Australian Curriculum. The Voice may make a representation seeking that a particular version of Australian history be taught in classrooms. Such representations would not operate in a policy vacuum. They would affect all Australians.",

He didn't specify that it had to be someone of First Nations descent; it was someone who understood the challenges of First Nations people. William Cooper, in 1937, asked for the very first voice to Australian parliament. At that time, the federal government denied William Cooper's request to send that petition to the royal family.

The purpose of the dialogues was to try to reach agreement among First Nations people on whether and how they would like to be recognised in the Australian Constitution.",

Ultimately, the form of the voice will emerge from the co-design process, but the lead point is that the voice will be designed with government but by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and adapted for local conditions right across the country. The voice will provide a mechanism for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to be consulted and engaged on the policies and laws that affect them.

In the recent blasting of the Juukan Gorge, we have seen stark examples of the destruction that can occur when mining companies are given free rein over large tracts of land. Taking empowerment to the next steps through constitutional recognition and the establishment of a voice to parliament is essential to the truth telling that Indigenous Australians demand and deserve.",

They're not even on our birth certificate, despite building and actually owning the hospital. For far too long white Anglo-Saxon men especially have made laws without any consultation or even consideration about how those laws will impact on First Nations people. For far too long we have been blind to the learnings of 60,000 years of caring for country by our First Nations peoples. In Moreton, we started the conversation to learn from 60,000 years of lessons\u20143,000 generations of passing down knowledge. Moreton is the most multicultural electorate in Queensland, so it is important to include our multicultural leaders in this conversation. We can all learn together.",

I would posit that the Uluru Statement from the Heart and that process would be the most effective model for the development of the cultural heritage truth-telling process. Enshrinement of the Indigenous voice to parliament in the Constitution is an important first step to that model. It was something that was much debated prior to the last election, and yet no progress has been made in this 46th Parliament by the Morrison government. The makarrata, which would be a venue in this House for Indigenous people to oversee policies and legislation that impact them, would be the most effective form of truth-telling process. It would be an active voice and one that would give individuals, governments and companies a clear avenue for engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural heritage issues.",

Marcia Langton and Tom Calma recommend that local and regional Voice bodies will need to be flexible, so their communities can determine how the representatives are appointed There is complexity between local, regional and state voices, as well as the parallel processes on agreement-making and truth-telling. We may not get it right at first. We need to have patience and the flexibility to change it as we learn. The Constitution is the governing principles, not this sort of complexity. It may take 10 years to get the Voice right, but, if we're committed to it in the Constitution, our legislative body can work through the details.",

The changes we make now, however, will extend to the referenda which follow: crucial moments of significant and fundamental change to the way our nation operates. As such, it's important that we all take a critical and forward-thinking approach to these reforms and that we undertake this debate with dignity, that we do it in a collegial spirit and, perhaps most importantly, that we do it with respect. I am heartened by the tone of the debate in relation to this bill, because this bill is almost a precursor to the Voice referendum itself.

We, as non-Indigenous Australians, cannot begin to fully understand the intergenerational trauma that is experienced as a result of the settlement of this country.

It is important that, if the parliament is going to make laws about Indigenous people, Indigenous people should be consulted about those laws.

He was critical of the model that was put up by the Constitutional Convention, which favoured a president elected by the parliament as opposed to a popularly elected president. I also got to know him through discussions we had about the law over the years. As conference convener of the Samuel Griffith Society, I invited Bob to give his thoughts on Indigenous constitutional recognition. It's fair to say he would have adopted a much more radical proposal than I or other members of the society would have been comfortable with. He was a much-sought-after after-dinner speaker given his long experience in the law and public affairs. He embodied the living history of our country. In more recent years, I've spoken to Bob about issues dealing with Indigenous recognition. Only a few weeks before his death, he sent me a long paper he'd written about the Makarrata and the Uluru statement more broadly. I'm honoured to follow in his footsteps as shadow minister for Indigenous Australians.",

The Uluru statement contains three things. The first is an enshrined voice in the Constitution. Labor have made a commitment that we will have a referendum towards that goal in our first term of government. The other thing is the establishment of a makarrata commission, which has two incredibly complex, lengthy and expensive things to do. They are a national process of truth-telling and a national process of agreement and treaty. Neither of those things are easy, but Labor is putting meat on the bones of what they might look like, what they might cost and how we might take them forward.

When the constitutional recognition committee, Indigenous Australians, got together to consider how they wanted to be recognised in our Constitution, how they wanted to be recognised in the birth certificate of our nation, they did not want a mere symbolic recognition. They didn't want to be simply included in the preamble of our Constitution; they didn't want a tick-a-box exercise. They wanted something substantive. The consensus ask they came up with was the Uluru Statement from the Heart and the Voice to Parliament. It's a great gift that we have been given\u2014a gift that is an opportunity for nation building.",

Instead of talking about a reset on closing the gap, I think it's time for a reset on the original relationships between First Nations people and the remainder of the Australian nationhood.

We should have that trusting relationship: both in ourselves as mature citizens, but also in our First Nations people and that they certainly do have the answers.

When Australians go to the polls this year, it will be a unique experience for many. For anyone born after 1981 it will be the first time they've ever voted in a referendum. When Australians go to the polls they will be asked to change the Constitution, to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. The Voice is about two things: recognition and consultation. Recognition of Australia's First Peoples in the nation's birth certificate, our Constitution\u2014something promised by successive governments over decades; and consultation, giving First Nations Australians a say in the policies that impact them. These are simple things but they're a huge step for our nation, and one that we really have such a great opportunity to take together this year at this referendum.",

One was to seek to have a voice in this parliament\u2014that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be consulted on the issues and policies that were directly impacting and affecting them and that they would have some mechanism to have a voice to parliament on those issues. Tragically, this was dismissed in circumstances that I think were grossly unfair. There were wildly inaccurate allegations at the time that this request for a voice to parliament was somehow the creation of a third chamber. We know this to be untrue. I think even those people who first thought that have subsequently acknowledged that that was not the case; I thank the member for New England for correcting the record and saying that he had got that wrong. Nonetheless, there was a lot of damage done. Within days, there was a complete rejection of the elements of the Uluru statement. These were issues that hurt deeply for a number of First Nations people.",

Healing is much harder than dividing people. It's a long road to walk, but it's the only one that leads to a strong, united and egalitarian Australia we can be proud to leave to our children. How it treats its children is a measure of what a society values. In the Christian tradition, human divinity appeared as an infant. Famous Russian novelist Dostoyevsky write that the tears of a single suffering child condemn the whole world if the child's tears are not atoned for. Reconciliation is this kind of atonement; it's turning the pages of painful chapters\u2014a telling of history with a trail of tears that allows for the opening of a new, inclusive chapter which we will write together. That's why we need a voice to parliament, that's why we need a referendum and that's why we need truth-telling.",

Has the Prime Minister already determined the outcome of the co-design process or will he genuinely listen to First Nations people through the process and deliver on an enshrined Indigenous voice to the parliament if that is the wish of First Nations people? The rub here, everyone, is that Minister Wyatt\u2014whom I have enormous respect for\u2014made a statement several weeks ago at the Press Club, only to have what I think was the Prime Minister's office coming in over the top and saying there will be no enshrined voice in the Constitution.

Joining each dialogue were a representative sample of approximately 100 First Nations people drawn from local traditional custodians, Indigenous community based organisations and Indigenous leaders. These regional dialogues selected their own representatives to attend the First Nations National Constitutional Convention at Uluru. At the convention, and by an overwhelming consensus, more than 250 delegates adopted the Uluru statement.
