        "0: not only frequently used,\n1: but was of various sorts, as _cypre_, No. 41. 99. 120. named probably\n2: from the isle of Cyprus, whence it might either come directly to us,\n3: or where it had received some improvement by way of refining. There\n4: is mention of _blanch-powder or white sugar_, 132. They, however,\n5: were not the same, for see No. 193. Sugar was clarified sometimes\n6: with wine [105].\n7: \n8: Spices. _Species_. They are mentioned in general No. 133, and _whole\n9: spices_, 167, 168. but they are more commonly specified, and are\n10: indeed greatly used, though being imported from abroad, and from so\n11: far as Italy or the Levant (and even there must be dear), some may\n12: wonder at this: but it shouid be considered, that our Roll was\n13: chiefly compiled for the use of noble and princely tables; and the\n14: same may be said of the Editor's MS. The spices came from the same\n15: part of the world, and by the same route, as sugar did. The _spicery_\n16: was an ancient department at court, and had its proper officers.\n17: \n18: As to the particular sorts, these are,\n19: \n20: Cinamon. _Canell_. 14. 191. _Canel_, Editor's MS. 10. _Kanell_, ibid.\n21: 32. is the Italian _Canella_. See Chaucer. We have the flour or\n22: powder, No. 20. 62. See Wiclif. It is not once mentioned in Apicius.\n23: \n24: Macys, 14. 121. Editor's MS. 10. _Maces_, 134. Editor's MS. 27. They\n25: are used whole, No. 158. and are always expressed plurally, though we\n26: now use the singular, _mace_. See Junii Etym.\n27: \n28: Cloves. No. 20. Dishes are flourished with them, 22. 158. Editor's MS.\n29: 10. 27. where we have _clowys gylofres_, as in our Roll, No. 104.\n30: _Powdour gylofre_ occurs 65. 191. Chaucer has _clowe_ in the singular,\n31: and see him v. Clove-gelofer.\n32: \n33: Galyngal, 30. and elsewhere. Galangal, the long rooted cyperus [106],\n34: is a warm cardiac and cephalic. It is used in powder, 30. 47. and was\n35: the chief ingredient in _galentine_, which, I think, took its name\n36: from it.\n37: \n38: Pepper. It appears from Pliny that this pungent, warm seasoning, so\n39: much in esteem at Rome [107], came from the East Indies [108], and,\n40: as we may suppose, by way of Alexandria. We obtained it no doubt, in\n41: the 14th century, from the same quarter, though not exactly by the\n42: same route, but by Venice or Genoa. It is used both whole, No. 35,\n43: and in powder, No. 83. And long-pepper occurs, if we read the place\n44: rightly, in No. 191.\n45: \n46: Ginger, gyngyn. 64. 136. alibi. Powder is used, 17. 20. alibi. and\n47: Rabelais IV. c. 59. the white powder, 131. and it is the name of a\n48: mess, 139. qu\u00e6re whether _gyngyn_ is not misread for _gyngyr_, for\n49: see Junii Etym. The Romans had their ginger from Troglodytica [109].\n50: \n51: Cubebs, 64. 121. are a warm spicy grain from the east.\n52: \n53: Grains of Paradice, or _de parys_, 137. [110] are the greater\n54: cardamoms.\n55: \n56: Noix muscadez, 191. nutmegs.\n57: \n58: The caraway is once mentioned, No. 53. and was an exotic from _Caria_,\n59: whence, according to Mr. Lye, it took its name: 'sunt semina, inquit,\n60: _carri_ vel _carrei_, sic dicti a Caria, ubi copiosissim\u00e8 nascitur\n61: [111].'\n62: \n63: Powder-douce, which occurs so often, has been thought by some, who\n64: have just peeped into our Roll, to be the same as sugar, and only a\n65: different name for it; but they are plainly mistaken, as is evident\n66: from 47. 51. 164. 165. where they are mentioned together as different\n67: things. In short, I take powder-douce to be either powder of\n68: galyngal, for see Editor's MS II. 20. 24, or a compound made of\n69: sundry aromatic spices ground or beaten small, and kept always ready\n70: at hand in some proper receptacle. It is otherwise termed _good\n71: powders_, 83. 130. and in Editor's MS 17. 37. 38 [112]. or _powder_\n72: simply, No. 169, 170. _White powder-douce_ occurs No. 51, which seems\n73: to be the same as blanch-powder, 132. 193. called _blaynshe powder_,\n74: and bought ready prepared, in Northumb. Book, p. 19. It is sometimes\n75: used with powder-fort, 38. 156. for which see the next and last\n76: article.\n77: \n78: Powder-fort, 10. 11. seems to be a mixture likewise of the warmer\n79: spices, pepper, ginger, &c. pulverized: hence we have _powder-fort of\n80: gynger, other of canel_, 14. It is called _strong powder_, 22. and\n81: perhaps may sometimes be intended by _good powders_. If you will",

These are not only many in number, but are often so\n11: horrid and barbarous, to our ears at least, as to be inveloped in\n12: several instances in almost impenetrable obscurity. Bishop Godwin\n13: complains of this so long ago as 1616 [115]. The _Contents_ prefixed\n14: will exhibit at once a most formidable list of these hideous names\n15: and titles, so that there is no need to report them here. A few of\n16: these terms the Editor humbly hopes he has happily enucleated, but\n17: still, notwithstanding all his labour and pains, the argument is in\n18: itself so abstruse at this distance of time, the helps so few, and\n19: his abilities in this line of knowledge and science so slender and\n20: confined, that he fears he has left the far greater part of the task\n21: for the more sagacious reader to supply: indeed, he has not the least\n22: doubt, but other gentlemen of curiosity in such matters (and this\n23: publication is intended for them alone) will be so happy as to clear\n24: up several difficulties, which appear now to him insuperable. It must\n25: be confessed again, thatthe Editor may probably have often failed in\n26: those very points, which he fancies and flatters himself to have\n27: elucidated, but this he is willing to leave to the candour of the\n28: public.\n29: \n30: Now in regard to the helps I mentioned; there is not much to be\n31: learnt from the Great Inthronization-feast of archbishop Robert\n32: Winchelsea, A. 1295, even if it were his; but I rather think it\n33: belongs to archbishop William Warham, A. 1504 [116]. Some use,\n34: however, has been made of it.\n35: \n36: Ralph Bourne was installed abbot of St. Augustine's, near Canterbury,\n37: A. 1309; and William Thorne has inserted a list of provisions bought\n38: for the feast, with their prices, in his Chronicle [117].\n39: \n40: The Great Feast at the Inthronization of George Nevile archbishop of\n41: York, 6 Edward IV. is printed by Mr. Hearne [118], and has been of\n42: good service.\n43: \n44: Elizabeth, queen of king Henry VII. was crowned A. 1487, and the\n45: messes at the dinner, in two courses, are registered in the late\n46: edition of Leland's Collectenea, A. 1770 [119], and we have profited\n47: thereby.\n48: \n49: The Lenten Inthronization-feast of archbishop William Warham, A. 1504\n50: [120], given us at large by Mr. Hearne [121], has been also consulted.\n51: \n52: There is a large catalogue of viands in Rabelais, lib. iv. cap. 59.\n53: 60. And the English translation of Mr. Ozell affording little\n54: information, I had recourse to the French original, but not to much\n55: more advantage.\n56: \n57: There is also a Royal Feast at the wedding of the earl of Devonshire,\n58: in the Harleian Misc. No. 279, and it has not been neglected.\n59: \n60: Randle Holme, in his multifarious _Academy of Armory_, has an\n61: alphabet of terms and dishes [122]; but though I have pressed him\n62: into the service, he has not contributed much as to the more\n63: difficult points.\n64: \n65: The Antiquarian Repertory, vol. II. p. 211, exhibits an\n66: entertainment of the mayor of Rochester, A. 1460; but there is little\n67: to be learned from thence. The present work was printed before No. 31\n68: of the Antiquarian Repertory, wherein some ancient recipes in Cookery\n69: are published, came to the Editor's hand.\n70: \n71: I must not omit my acknowledgments to my learned friend the present\n72: dean of Carlisle, to whom I stand indebted for his useful notes on\n73: the Northumberland-Household Book, as also for the book itself.\n74: \n75: Our chief assistance, however, has been drawn from a MS belonging to\n76: the Editor, denoted, when cited, by the signature _MS.
